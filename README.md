crazyroids.asm is the main file.

There are two build scripts - both use the pasmo assembler. https://pasmo.speccy.org/

MS Windows: 
 1) install pasmo.exe and make sure the build script file build_using_pasmo.bat has the correct path
 2) run buildWindows.bat to build

Linux:
 1) if not already done so install pasmo using whatever method your distro allows
 2) run buildLinux.sh to build
